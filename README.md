# Reciprocity to enable Decentralized Freemiums Dapps

We use the Measured Transfer Protocol - that uses the concept of reciprocity as a means to reduces barriers of entries for new users, to make available surplus tokens, and overall create a means to stabilize fluctuating values.

We leverage the power of the blockchain to define a stable value measurement and systematically assure reciprocity in order to create a universal sharing economy.

In our Demo, we use a proxy delegate architecture to extend and interact with Dapps that are enlisted in our StakedTrials - Universal Sharing Economy. This demonstrates a way for users to use the dapp, claim tokens and continue to grow your user community through a freemium model.
